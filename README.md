## ⚠️ Important Security Notice (PLEASE READ)

This application is built using **PowerShell and packaged as an EXE**.

Because of this, **some antivirus engines may flag the executable as suspicious or malicious**.  
This is a **false positive** caused by heuristic and machine-learning detection.

### Why this happens
- PowerShell-based executables are commonly abused by malware
- This tool requires **Administrator privileges**
- It deletes files recursively from temporary locations

### What this tool does NOT do
- ❌ No data collection
- ❌ No network communication
- ❌ No persistence (startup, scheduled tasks, services)
- ❌ No registry changes
- ❌ No hidden behavior

You are encouraged to:
- Review the source code (`WinTempCleaner.ps1`)
- Run the script directly instead of the EXE if preferred
- Use this tool only if you understand what it does

---

## 🛡 Antivirus Detections (False Positives)

Some antivirus products may detect the EXE as:
- `Trojan`
- `AI.Malicious`
- `SusGen`

These detections are **heuristic-based**, not signature-based.

If you are concerned:
- Run the `.ps1` script directly
- Build the EXE yourself from source
- Add a local exclusion if you trust the tool
